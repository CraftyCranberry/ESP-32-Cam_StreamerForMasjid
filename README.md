# Automtic Streamer for my local Mosque

I did this project for the local mosque at the University of Nottingham Malaysia.

The objective was to be able to flick one switch and have a stream automatically start on a wirelessly connected device to an ESP 32. This was so that the sisters can see the brothers side to know which part of the prayer is ongoing if they join late. It also helps them in many other scenarios.

The code I used has been uploaded above. 

# Pictures 
Here are some pictures of the final thing I came up with.

I had plans to design and 3D Print a case for this but due to time contrains that ended up not happening :)

Fusing resistors into stems of LEDs and soldering to make it neat!

# Notes
  * The samsung tablet used was way too old! It couldn't even display the video! Thankfully though, I installed a custom ROM (a custom, newer version of Android made by someone on XDA and that was pretty much it!
  * This is not meant to be a set up guide! Use it as a reference and do your research and testing. That's the fun part!
  * Thanks to everyone whos work I've used here!
